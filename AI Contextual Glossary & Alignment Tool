AI Contextual Glossary & Alignment Tool
Welcome to this repository! This resource is designed to serve as a shared, extensible language resource for AI and Machine Learning terminology.
Whether you're working on a simple "cat game" logic update, optimizing a Virtual Machine (VM) upgrade pipeline in Azure, or developing new marketing models, having a consistent understanding of core concepts is crucial for team alignment and decision-making.
If you're new to GitHub, that's great! We appreciate your participation. Please feel free to suggest new terms, clarify existing definitions, or provide examples via Pull Requests or Issues.
1. Core AI Definitions (The Building Blocks)
These are the fundamental technical concepts used across all AI-driven projects.
Term
	Definition
	Contextual Alignment / "Tie-Breaker" Notes
	Artificial Intelligence (AI)
	The broad field encompassing systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve based on the information they collect.
	Tie-Breaker: Not just Machine Learning. AI includes older logic-based systems (expert systems, search algorithms). Use AI when discussing the goal (intelligent behavior).
	Machine Learning (ML)
	A subset of AI where systems automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML models are trained on data to recognize patterns and make predictions.
	Tie-Breaker: Use ML when discussing the method (training an algorithm on data). If the system gets better with more data, it's ML.
	Neural Network (NN)
	A foundational component of Deep Learning, structured like the human brain, composed of interconnected layers (nodes/neurons) that process and transmit information.
	Context: Key to Azure and VM projects where hardware acceleration (GPUs) is used. Often used for complex pattern recognition (vision, speech).
	Large Language Model (LLM)
	A type of Deep Learning model trained on massive amounts of text data, enabling it to understand, generate, and summarize human language.
	Context: Core to Portals and customer service/knowledge management tools. If text generation is involved, the discussion centers here.
	Training Data
	The initial dataset used to teach an ML model to perform a specific task. The quality, size, and relevance of this data directly determine the model's performance.
	Tie-Breaker: In Marketing Models, this is usually historical customer behavior, purchasing patterns, or campaign responses.
	Inference
	The process of using a trained ML model to make a prediction or decision on new, unseen data.
	Context: For Upgrades or VM use, inference speed (latency) is often the key performance indicator (KPI).
	Model Bias
	A skew in a model's outcome due to unrepresentative or flawed data used during training, leading to unfair or inaccurate predictions for specific groups.
	Context: Critical for Compliance and Azure governance. Must be addressed before deploying models that affect real users.
	2. Key Roles and Contextual Engagement
Understanding who is involved and how they interact with the definitions helps align expectations across different project types.
Role/Concept
	Definition
	Application Across Contexts (Games, VMs, Marketing)
	Subject Matter Expert (SME)
	An individual recognized as possessing deep knowledge and expertise in a specific domain (e.g., Cat Game mechanics, Azure deployment, Customer retention).
	The Aligning Role: The SME validates the training data, defines the ground truth, and ensures the AI model's output is practically correct for the given domain.
	Ground Truth
	The verified, accurate real-world information or data labels used to train or evaluate an AI model. It is the ideal result the model should aim for.
	Tie-Breaker: In a Cat Game, the ground truth might be the optimal path a cat should take; in Marketing Models, it's the confirmed successful/failed outcome of a campaign.
	Feature Engineering
	The process of transforming raw data into features (variables) that best represent the underlying problem to improve model accuracy.
	Context: Highly intensive in Marketing Models (creating variables like "days since last purchase") but might be simpler in a Virtual Machine context (system logs, CPU utilization).
	Interpretability
	The degree to which a human can understand the reasons behind a model's decision.
	Context: Essential for Azure/Compliance. If a VM is flagged for security (a decision), the system must be able to explain why it was flagged. Less critical for simple Cat Games.
	Reinforcement Learning (RL)
	A type of ML where an "agent" learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.
	Context: Often used in complex Games (AI opponents) or VM optimization (choosing resources to maximize throughput).
	3. Compliance and Extensibility Statement
This glossary is designed to be an expansive, dynamic, and unlimited resource, meant to grow and evolve with the technology and the needs of its contributors.
Compliance Statement
We affirm that this resource is intended for public, non-commercial use as a foundational alignment tool. Its purpose is to foster clear communication in collaborative development environments, spanning casual projects to enterprise-level architecture (like Azure/VMs). The definitions are meant to be starting points—not immutable law—and are subject to ongoing refinement by the community. By contributing, users agree that this resource is open and available for use, adaptation, and expansion as needed for other open-source or internal applications.
Contribution and Usage
* New to GitHub? That's perfectly fine! The simplest way to contribute is to open an Issue if you see a definition that needs clarification or if you have a new term to suggest.
* More experienced users are encouraged to submit Pull Requests with suggested changes to the definitions or the addition of new contextual tables.
* This file is licensed under the MIT License, encouraging maximum usage and adaptation.
Let's build a better shared vocabulary together!
