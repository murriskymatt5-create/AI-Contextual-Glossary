📚 AI Contextual Glossary & Alignment Tool

Welcome to the AI Contextual Glossary & Alignment Tool! This repository's mission is to solve one of the most common challenges in cross-functional tech projects: language alignment.

We aim to create a single, clear source of truth for essential AI and Machine Learning terminology, focusing on how these concepts change meaning when applied to different domains—from simple games to complex enterprise systems.

🚀 The Mission: The Tie-Breaker Mechanism

This glossary is designed to be the ultimate tie-breaker for debates and miscommunications across teams.

Whether you're dealing with:

Game Development: Optimizing "cat game" logic or AI opponent behavior.

Cloud Infrastructure (Azure/VMs): Planning virtual machine upgrades and performance monitoring.

Business Applications: Building portals or developing complex marketing models.

...our definitions provide clear contextual notes to ensure everyone is operating from the same conceptual foundation.
